    Listen, my children, and you shall hear <br/>
    Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,<br/>
    On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-Five:<br/>
    Hardly a man is now alive<br/>
    Who remembers that famous day and year.<br/>
    <br/>
    He said to his friend, “If the British march<br/>
    By land or sea from the town to-night,<br/>
    Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry-arch<br/>
    Of the North-Church-tower, as a signal-light,--<br/>
    One if by land, and two if by sea;<br/>
    And I on the opposite shore will be,<br/>
    Ready to ride and spread the alarm<br/>
    Through every Middlesex village and farm,<br/>
    For the country-folk to be up and to arm.”<br/>
    <br/>
    Then he said “Good night!” and with muffled oar<br/>
    Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore,<br/>
    Just as the moon rose over the bay,<br/>
    Where swinging wide at her moorings lay<br/>
    The Somerset, British man-of-war:<br/>
    A phantom ship, with each mast and spar<br/>
    Across the moon, like a prison-bar,<br/>
    And a huge black hulk, that was magnified<br/>
    By its own reflection in the tide.<br/>
    <br/>
    Meanwhile, his friend, through alley and street<br/>
    Wanders and watches with eager ears,<br/>
    Till in the silence around him he hears<br/>
    The muster of men at the barrack door,<br/>
    The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet,<br/>
    And the measured tread of the grenadiers<br/>
    Marching down to their boats on the shore.<br/>
    <br/>
    Then he climbed to the tower of the church,<br/>
    Up the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread,<br/>
    To the belfry-chamber overhead,<br/>
    And startled the pigeons from their perch<br/>
    On the sombre rafters, that round him made<br/>
    Masses and moving shapes of shade,--<br/>
    By the trembling ladder, steep and tall,<br/>
    To the highest window in the wall,<br/>
    Where he paused to listen and look down<br/>
    A moment on the roofs of the town,<br/>
    And the moonlight flowing over all.<br/>
    <br/>
    Beneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead,<br/>
    In their night-encampment on the hill,<br/>
    Wrapped in silence so deep and still<br/>
    That he could hear, like a sentinel’s tread,<br/>
    The watchful night-wind, as it went<br/>
    Creeping along from tent to tent,<br/>
    And seeming to whisper, “All is well!”<br/>
    A moment only he feels the spell<br/>
    Of the place and the hour, and the secret dread<br/>
    Of the lonely belfry and the dead;<br/>
    For suddenly all his thoughts are bent<br/>
    On a shadowy something far away,<br/>
    Where the river widens to meet the bay, --<br/>
    A line of black, that bends and floats<br/>
    On the rising tide, like a bridge of boats.<br/>
    <br/>
    Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride,<br/>
    Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride,<br/>
    On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere.<br/>
    Now he patted his horse’s side,<br/>
    Now gazed on the landscape far and near,<br/>
    Then impetuous stamped the earth,<br/>
    And turned and tightened his saddle-girth;<br/>
    But mostly he watched with eager search<br/>
    The belfry-tower of the old North Church,<br/>
    As it rose above the graves on the hill,<br/>
    Lonely and spectral and sombre and still.<br/>
    And lo! as he looks, on the belfry’s height,<br/>
    A glimmer, and then a gleam of light!<br/>
    He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,<br/>
    But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight<br/>
    A second lamp in the belfry burns!<br/>
    <br/>
    A hurry of hoofs in a village-street,<br/>
    A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,<br/>
    And beneath from the pebbles, in passing, a spark<br/>
    Struck out by a steed that flies fearless and fleet:<br/>
    That was all! And yet, through the gloom and the light,<br/>
    The fate of a nation was riding that night;<br/>
    And the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight,<br/>
    Kindled the land into flame with its heat.<br/>
    <br/>
    He has left the village and mounted the steep,<br/>
    And beneath him, tranquil and broad and deep,<br/>
    Is the Mystic, meeting the ocean tides;<br/>
    And under the alders, that skirt its edge,<br/>
    Now soft on the sand, now loud on the ledge,<br/>
    Is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides.<br/>
    <br/>
    It was twelve by the village clock<br/>
    When he crossed the bridge into Medford town.<br/>
    He heard the crowing of the cock,<br/>
    And the barking of the farmer’s dog,<br/>
    And felt the damp of the river-fog,<br/>
    That rises when the sun goes down.<br/>
    <br/>
    It was one by the village clock,<br/>
    When he galloped into Lexington.<br/>
    He saw the gilded weathercock<br/>
    Swim in the moonlight as he passed,<br/>
    And the meeting-house windows, blank and bare,<br/>
    Gaze at him with a spectral glare,<br/>
    As if they already stood aghast<br/>
    At the bloody work they would look upon.<br/>
    <br/>
    It was two by the village clock,<br/>
    When be came to the bridge in Concord town.<br/>
    He heard the bleating of the flock,<br/>
    And the twitter of birds among the trees,<br/>
    And felt the breath of the morning breeze<br/>
    Blowing over the meadows brown.<br/>
    And one was safe and asleep in his bed<br/>
    Who at the bridge would be first to fall,<br/>
    Who that day would be lying dead,<br/>
    Pierced by a British musket-ball.<br/>
    <br/>
    You know the rest. In the books you have read,<br/>
    How the British Regulars fired and fled,--<br/>
    How the farmers gave them ball for ball,<br/>
    From behind each fence and farmyard-wall,<br/>
    Chasing the red-coats down the lane,<br/>
    Then crossing the fields to emerge again<br/>
    Under the trees at the turn of the road,<br/>
    And only pausing to fire and load.<br/>
    <br/>
    So through the night rode Paul Revere;<br/>
    And so through the night went his cry of alarm<br/>
    To every Middlesex village and farm,--<br/>
    A cry of defiance, and not of fear,<br/>
    A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,<br/>
    And a word that shall echo forevermore!<br/>
    For, borne on the night-wind of the Past,<br/>
    Through all our history, to the last,<br/>
    In the hour of darkness and peril and need,<br/>
    The people will waken and listen to hear<br/>
    The hurrying hoof-beats of that steed,<br/>
    And the midnight message of Paul Revere.<br/>
